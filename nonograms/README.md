## How to Play

Nonograms are images that are generated by following hints that associated with a grid. The hints are sequences of numbers, which mean that the row or column that they're next to should contain those groupings in order to be completed. For example, a row may have the numbers "2 1 4" next to it, meaning that that row should have a sequence of two filled-in blocks, followed by a single filled-in block, and finally, a sequence of four. Once all of the cells are filled in properly, an image will form.
